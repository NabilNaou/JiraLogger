This is a Jira Time Logger. This is a tool I made to make it easier to log time directly from your IDE to Jira. During my work hours, I noticed that my coworkers and I would often forget to log our hours in jira. With this extension, this can be automated, or used as a reminder.

Features
- Automatic Time Logging: Automatically logs time for each branch you work on
- Commit Reminder: Interface for when you commit, showing the hours worked. Adjustable if needed.

How to use
1. Download Plugin into any jetbrains IDE.
2. Go to settings -> version control. There will be a new tab named "Jira time logger" or the like. Insert your e-mail, Api key, and jira base url.
3. Make sure your branches follow the normal format, where you use the issue ID. Example: SCRUM-1: Test or SCRUM-1_ Test. SCRUM-1 being the issue ID.
